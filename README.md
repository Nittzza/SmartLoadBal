# SmartLoadBalancer

A smart home energy management system that monitors and balances power consumption across connected appliances.


## 🚀 Overview

SmartLoadBalancer helps users optimize electricity usage by automatically managing connected appliances based on priority levels and power thresholds. When total consumption exceeds a user-defined threshold, the system intelligently turns off low-priority devices while keeping critical appliances running.

## ✨ Key Features

- Real-time power consumption monitoring via smart plugs
- Automatic load balancing based on user-defined priorities
- Detailed analytics on energy usage patterns
- Critical device protection
- Usage pattern detection and visualization
- Simple, intuitive user interface

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets

## 📊 How It Works

1. Smart plugs collect power consumption data from connected appliances
2. System monitors total power usage in real-time
3. When usage exceeds threshold, load balancing algorithm activates
4. Non-critical appliances are turned off according to priority until usage is under threshold
5. All actions and consumption patterns are logged for analytics
